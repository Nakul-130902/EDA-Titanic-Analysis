# EDA-Titanic-Analysis
# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the given dataset as part of my internship.  
The objective is to clean, explore, and visualize the data to uncover insights, detect patterns, and highlight anomalies.

## 🔍 EDA Process
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Fixing data types  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Percentiles  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Pairplots  
   - Correlation Heatmaps  
   - Category-wise comparisons  

4. **Key Insights**  
   - Example: Survival rate was higher for females and passengers in first class  
   - Example: Older passengers had a lower survival rate
